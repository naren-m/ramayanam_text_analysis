1::14::31:: Kausalya, in her devotion to duty and with a happy state of mind, passed one night near that horse.
1::14::32::Hota, Adhvaryu and Udgata arranged Mahishi, Parivritti, Vavaata and another woman known as Palakali to touch (keep the company of) the sacrificial horse.

1::14::43::O ruler of the earth We are constantly engaged in the study of the Vedas. We are not capable of ruling the earth and we cannot do anything with its possession. Give some other charity in lieu of that.
1::14::44::O best of men give us gems or gold or cows or whichever is readily available. We have no use with this earth.
1::14::45::Lord of men, the king having been thus addressed by brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas, bestowed on them ten hundred thousand cows, a hundred crore of gold coins and four times as much in silver coins.
1::14::46::All the priests collectively offered that wealth to sage Rsyasringa and Vasishta endowed with prudence.

1::14::51::Brahmins uttered blessings upon the generous king when he prostrated before them according to procedure.
1::14::52::Sacrifice destroys sins. It leads to heaven. It is incapable of being done by other monarchs. King Dasaratha was very much pleased after performing this great sacrifice.
1::14::53::King Dasaratha then addressing Rsyasringa said O Adherent of vows you can help the continuity of my race.
1::14::54::Rsyasringa, the best of brahmins, addressing the king said, O King Let it be. Four sons perpetuating your race will be born to you.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुर्दशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
