5::29::1::Like wellwishers flocking round a person on whom fortune is smiling, omens foretelling auspicious happenings in near future appeared to Sita. She was unimpeachable. She was in agony, distressed in mind, bereft of all joy (now) standing under that Simsupa tree. 
5::29::2::Her left eye with a row of curved eyelashes, the black pupils of the eye in white throbbed in an auspicious manner. The lady  with her long tresses, and throbbing eye appeared like a red lotus gently struck by a fish.
5::29::3::Her stout left arm curved beautifully, fit for excellent agaru and sandal paste once the pillow by her beloved lord for long, throbbed suddenly.
5::29::4::Again her roundshaped left thigh resembling an elephant's trunk started throbbing, presaging union with Rama.
5::29::5::Her eyes were pristine, teeth wellshaped. The goldhued auspicious sari on her charming limbs was now a little soiled on account of dust. It slipped slightly as she stood up. This augured well for her.
5::29::6::Reassured by such omens which augured well as tested by time, Sita, with beautiful eyebrows, and deep foresight experienced great joy, like a seed blighted by the wind and the Sun comes back to joyful life through a pleasing shower. (A foreteller is addressed as siddha in sanskrit dramas)
5::29::7::Her face shining with beautiful red lips like bimba fruit, sparkling teeth, and curved eyelashes with lovely brows extending up to her hair, she appeared like a Moon released from the mouth of Rahu.
5::29::8::Revered Sita, completely relieved of grief, exhaustion gone, fears allayed, mind illumined with joy, looked charming with her countenance as a night with the Moon fully risen during the bright fortnight.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये सुन्दरकाण्डे एकोनत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic compsed by sage Valmiki.
