5::60::1::After hearing Hanuman,  Vali's son said O vanaras (Hanuman) having seen Sita it is not proper on our part to go without Sita to the great soul Rama.
5::60::2::O vanaras, you are known for your valour. I think, to tell Rama that we have seen Sita but not brought her is not proper.
5::60::3::O noble vanaras Indeed either among gods or among demons there is none who can match the vanaras in leaping and exhibiting valour.
5::60::4::Hence, having killed the heroes among ogres what other task has Hanuman to do? Let us get Sita.
5::60::5::Jambavan, the noble vanara, skilled in the execution of tasks thus commanded in a determined manner:
5::60::6::O prince what you think is  acceptable to us also. Even though we are capable of achieving, knowing what is in Rama's mind, we should act only according to his command to accomplish the task.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये सुन्दरकाण्डे षष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtieth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramyana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
