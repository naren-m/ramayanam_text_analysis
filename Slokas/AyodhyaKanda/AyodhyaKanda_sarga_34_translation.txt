2::34::1:: Let my father be informed of my arrival, said the lotuseyed, darkcomplexioned, venerable, peerless Rama to the charioteer.
2::34::2::At the command of Rama, charioteer Sumantra whose senses were overwhelmed with grief quickly entered the apartment of the king and found him heaving sighs.
2::34::3::He saw the lord of the world (Dasaratha) dull like the Sun in eclipse, like the fire covered with ashes, like a tank with its water dried up.
2::34::4::Seeing the king brooding over Rama, in an extremely agitated state, the sagacious charioteer approached him with folded hands.
2::34::5::At first greeting the king with the words 'victory be yours', the charioteer, trembling with fear, gently said in a feeble voice. 
2::34::6::Your son Rama, the  best of men, having given away his entire wealth in charity to brahmins and to all the dependents is waiting at the entrance.                     
2::34::7::Be blessed audience may be granted to Rama who possesses proven prowess, and now waits, after taking leave of his friends, to see you. 
2::34::8::O Lord of the world behold him embellished with all princely virtues like the Sun encircled with its rays, (now) leaving for the forest. 
2::34::9::That truthful and virtuous king (Dasaratha) who was deep like the ocean and free from mud (pure) like the  sky replied:
2::34::10::O Sumantra bring all my consorts who are here. In the company of all my wives, I desire to give audience to virtuous Rama.
2::34::11:: O venerable ones, king Dasaratha summons you. Go there without delay, said Sumantra to the king's consorts after crossing the inner apartment.
2::34::12:: Thus addressed by Sumantra in accordance with the king's order, all the women went to their husband's palace.
2::34::13::Thereafter, Kausalya surrounded by three hundred and fifty  ladies who were faithful to their vows, reached there slowly with their eyes turned copperred (in grief).
2::34::14::Usher in my son (Rama), O Sumantra, said the lord of the world (king Dasaratha) to the charioteer on seeing his wives arrive.
2::34::15:: Then the charioteer fetched Rama, Lakshmana and Sita and advanced towards the king without delay. 
2::34::16::When the king saw from a distance his son coming with folded hands, he, surrounded by the ladies and tormented with grief, stood up. 
2::34::17::At the sight of Rama, the lord of men (king Dasaratha), tortured with grief, immediately ran towards him but  before he could reach him, fell unconscious on the floor.
2::34::18::Rama and the mighty warrior Lakshmana, quickly reached the king who lay as though  he had lost his senses due to grief.
2::34::19::All on a sudden there arose from (the mouths of) a thousand women of the palace cries of 'alas, alas, Rama' mingled with the tinkling sounds of their ornaments. 
2::34::20::Thereafter Rama and Lakshmana assisted by Sita, lifted him wailing in their arms and laid him on a couch.
2::34::21::After the king regained his consciousness in a moment, Rama with folded hands said to him, who was immersed in a sea of sorrow:
2::34::22::O great king, I am asking leave of you, for you are lord of  all of us. I am set to depart  for the Dandaka forest. See me (off) in a cheerful mood.
2::34::23::Allow Lakshmana and Sita to follow me into the forest. I tried to dissuade them with a number of reasons but they did not agree.
2::34::24:: Discard your grief and, like Brahma, the creator, allow Lakshmana, Sita and me all of us, your subjects, O respector of men
2::34::25:: On seeing Rama, unruffled, waiting for his permission to proceed to the forest, the lord of the earth, king Dasaratha said:
2::34::26::I have been deluded by Kaikeyi into bestowing boons. Imprison me and be now king of Ayodhya, O scion of the Raghu dynasty
2::34::27:: Thus spoken to by the king, Rama, skilled in speech and upholder of righteousness, replied to his father with folded palms: 
2::34::28::You will remain the lord of this earth for a thousand years to come, O king As for me, I will dwell in the forest. Do not deviate from truth on my account.
2::34::29::Having fulfilled the vow on the completion of fourteen years of wandering in the forest I shall come back to touch your feet, O lord of men
2::34::30::The king who was bound by the cord of truth and instigated by Kaikeyi said, wailing in distress:
2::34::31::Go, my dear child, wish you wellMay your path be auspicious, free from obstacles and fear (from any quarters). Come back (after fulfilment of the pledge)
2::34::32::O my beloved son O delight of the Raghus you are devoted to truth and duty. It is difficult to dissuade you from your resolve .
2::34::33::O son, by all means, do not go now, today, tonight Give me, at least, one day more to see (by with) you to my satisfaction. 
2::34::34:: Stay tonight in the company of your mother and me. With all our desire satisfied, you can set out tomorrow at the appropriate time.
2::34::35::O my son, O descendant of the Raghus, you are called upon to accomplish, by all means, a very difficult task. For the sake of my pleasure you are forsaking your dear ones and going to the desolate forest. 
2::34::36:: I swear by truth, O my beloved son, that your departure to the forest is in no way a pleasure to me. With a hidden motive, this woman who is like fire  concealed by ashes has duped me.
2::34::37:: Instigated by this Kaikeyi, the destroyer of traditions (of the race) I have been deceived for which you wish to pay. 
2::34::38::It is not a great surprise that you, O my son, being the eldest, want to make your father free from a false promise.
2::34::39:: Rama and Lakshmana were sad to hear the words of their anguished father. Rama replies:
2::34::40::Who will give me the merit (of propriety) I earn today? Therefore, I want to depart (today), discarding all my desires.
2::34::41::The kingdom abdicated by me with all its people, its wealth and foodgrains may be bestowed on Bharata.
2::34::42:: My decision to go to the forest remains unchanged. O bestower of boons, O king  honour to the last word the boons you had granted Kaikeyi. And adhere to truth.
2::34::43:: As already said, I shall dwell in the forest for fourteen years with forest rangers, in obedience to your commands.
2::34::44::Do not brood. Bestow the kingdom on Bharata. I do not have any desire for the kingdom or pleasure. Nothing is dearer to me than compliance with your order, O Delight of the Raghu race
2::34::45:: Let your grief go. Do not shed tears. The indomitable ocean, Lord of rivers, is never perturbed. 
2::34::46::I desire no kingdom, no comfort, not this earth nor any pleasure nor heaven nor even life.
2::34::47::I wish you, O best of men, to uphold truth and not falsehood. I swear this in your presence in the name of truth and on my merits acquired.
2::34::48::It is not possible for me, O father to stay here for a moment any longer. Restrain your grief. There can be no change in my resolve, O king
2::34::49::'O Rama, go to the forest', Kaikeyi had said, and I have given her word I would go. I must fulfil my promise. 
2::34::50::Do not worry, O Lord We will enjoy (our stay in) the peaceful forest full of deer and resounding with the chirpings of various birds.
2::34::51::Father is divine even for the gods as cited in scriptures, therefore, looking upon father as my god, I will carry out his words, O father
2::34::52:: I shall return after fourteen years have passed, O best among men you will see me back, Give up this grief. 
2::34::53::When you, O tiger among men, are required (as king) to pacify those whose throats are choked with tears, why this change in you?
2::34::54::I am renouncing this city, kingdom and this entire earth, and let all this be conferred on Bharata. In obedience to your order, I shall go and live in the forest for a long time.
2::34::55::I am leaving behind, O king this (auspicious) land with its welllaid boundaries, mountain ranges, cities and forests, which Bharata alone should rule. Let it happen the way you have said. 
2::34::56::O king my mind derives no happiness from great enjoyment or personal comfort as it does from carrying out your order. This is corroborated by the wise. Your grief (relating to filfilment of the vow) on mt account will be dispelled, O sinless one
2::34::57:: O sinless one by associating you with falsehood I will neither seek this eternal kingdom nor objects of desires nor objects of happiness nor Maithili nor even my life. I only wish that your vow comes true.
2::34::58:: Entering the forest full of various kinds of trees I shall be happy to view the mountains, rivers and the lakes and to eat fruits and roots. (Hence) do not grieve. 
2::34::59::The king, immersed in anguish and distressed with tears of grief embraced his son and then fell down unconscious on the floor and lay motionless. 
2::34::60::Thereupon all the queens except Kaikeyi, wailed loudly. Sumantra, too, cried and fell unconscious. The entire palace cried 'Alas, Alas'.  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे चतुस्त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the  holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
