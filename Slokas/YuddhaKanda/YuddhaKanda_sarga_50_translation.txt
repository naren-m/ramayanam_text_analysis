6::50::1::Extremely brilliant and mighty Sugriva looking at the army of Vanaras said, Why are you worried like a boat tossed by wind in water?
6::50::2::On hearing Sugriva's question, Angada the son of Vali said, Did you not see Dasaratha's sons Rama and chariot warrior Lakshmana, the great souls lying on a bed of arrows bathed in blood?
6::50::3::Then Vanara king Sugriva looking at Angada said, I do not think that the Vanaras running like this is not without any cause. Maybe out of fear of some reason ahead.
6::50::4::Here, the distressed Vanaras with sad faces, their eyes downcast, are fleeing in all directions abandoning their arms.
6::50::5::Without waiting to look back at others, not shy to see one another, the Vanaras are distancing themselves from those fallen and are seen fleeing.
6::50::6::In the meantime, heroic Vibheeshana holding mace came to Sugriva and Rama and cheered with victory.
6::50::7::Beholding Vibheeshana, the Vanaras fled, said Sugriva to the great Jambavan who stood near him.
6::50::8::Vibheeshana has come here. Beholding him the foremost of the Vanaras fleeing suspecting him to be the son of Ravana.
6::50::9::Call them back who are running in different directions quickly. Tell them Vibheeshana has come here.
6::50::10::Sugriva having spoken in that way, the king of Bears, Jambavan restored the confidence of Vanaras.
6::50::11::Having heard Jambavan, all the Vanaras finally shed their fear and returned to see Vibheeshana.
6::50::12::On seeing the body of Rama and Lakshmana fully covered by arrows, Vibheeshana also became piteous and sad.
6::50::13::Vibheeshana, wetting his hands with water cleaned the eyes of Rama and Lakshmana. Tormented with pain he cried aloud.
6::50::14::Both the princess, who are endowed with good nature, and power are fond of combat. The Rakshasas have reduced them to this state by their deceitful ways.
6::50::15::The princess who were guileless in their prowess were cheated by my evil minded and stupid son of my brother by his crooked thinking and cheating.
6::50::16::Pierced with arrows, fully covered with blood, the bodies of the two princes appear like porcupines sleeping on the ground.
6::50::17::These two bulls among men of great valour and fame whose refuge was sought by me are lying asleep wounded all over and limbs broken.
6::50::18::Having lost my life ambition for the kingdom, frustrated I am. My enemy Ravana, having succeeded in his vow, did this deed.
6::50::19::To Vibheeshana who was lamenting in that way, Sugriva, who was endowed with good qualities embraced him and spoke.
6::50::20::O righteous one! there is no doubt that you will attain the kingdom of Lanka. Ravana and his sons will not attain what they desire.
6::50::21::Both these heroes Raghava and Lakshmana wounded and pained having shaken off from their unconscious state will kill Ravana and his army in war.
6::50::22::Thus, consoling and pacifying, the Rakshasa, Vibheeshana in that manner, Sugriva turned to his uncle Sushena and spoke.
6::50::23::On regaining consciousness, take the brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the tamers of enemies to Kishkinda accompanied by the heroic monkey army.
6::50::24::On killing Ravana and his sons along with his kin, I will on my part also bring Mythili just as Indra recovered his prosperity.
6::50::25::Hearing the words of Vanara Lord, Sushena spoke about the fierce and great war that he had experienced between Devas and asuras.
6::50::26::Then the Rakshasas adept in using arms went about agitating concealing themselves, attacking Devatas who were learned in using arms.
6::50::27::Brhaspati, the priest restored the wounded and lifeless, unconscious by means of reciting mantras, prayers and treatment by herbs.
6::50::28::Let Sampati and Panasa go quickly to the milky ocean in a swift phase to get those medicines.
6::50::29::Those monkeys only know the supreme medicine available in the mountains. They have to get Sanjeevakarani and Visalyakarani known to Brahma.
6::50::30::There, where the milky ocean, the foremost of oceans, was churned, two mountains have risen by the name Chandra and Drona. The supreme herbs of medicine are present there.
6::50::31::Both the mountains are well known. Deities have kept the herbal medicine there. Let the son of wind god, Hanuman proceed.
6::50::32::In the mean while winds blew, clouds also rose up, water in the ocean was scattered about by the wind and lightning appeared in the sky.
6::50::33::All the huge trees of the island were broken by the flutter of the wings (of Garuda) and fell into the salt water of the ocean.
6::50::34::All the serpents and sea monsters inhabiting there terrified at Garuda went quickly into the salty waters of the ocean.
6::50::35::Then all the Vanaras perceived Garuda endowed with mighty prowess, the son of Vinatha blazing like fire.
6::50::36::Seeing the noble Rama and Lakshmana bound by the serpents in the form of arrows (released by Indrajith), the serpents fled.
6::50::37::Thereafter Garuda paying his respects to the noble Rama and Lakshmana, touching their feet, wiped their face which shone like the moon.
6::50::38::Caressed by Garuda, both their bodies were cleared of wounds instantly shone like gold and turned bright.
6::50::39::Their brilliance, prowess, daring courage, intelligence, memory, and great qualities got manifested many folds.
6::50::40::Raising up both the princes who were extraordinarily brilliant and equalled Indra, Garuda embraced Rama joyfully and thus spoke.
6::50::41::By your kindness, we have overcome this calamity caused by Ravana's son and regained our strength as before.
6::50::42::For me to meet you is like meeting my father Dasaratha and grandfather, Aja. My heart rejoices.
6::50::43::Who are you, richly endowed with charming appearance, smeared with unguents adored in dust free garments, wearing beautiful ornaments?
6::50::44::To Rama whose eyes were filled with joyful tears, Vinatha, the king of birds, full of brightness and strength said.
6::50::45::O Kakuthsa! I am Garuthman, your dear friend and your outer breath. I reached here to help you.
6::50::46::For the demons endowed with great strength and of mighty valour or for Gandharvas, or Vanaras or for even Devatas, or Indra who has done a hundred sacrifices, it is not possible to get relieved from bondage of the arrows of Indrajith of cruel deeds carried out by tricks.
6::50::47::These arrows are serpents born of Kadra Devata. They have sharp fangs and are highly poisonous. By the tricks of Rakshasa, it has turned into arrows and reached you.
6::50::48::You are lucky and also Lakshmana your brother, destroyer of foes in war. Rama your strength is truth, and you are righteous.
6::50::49::Having heard the information about both of you bound by serpents, out of my friendship and affection and in obedience to you I hastened and reached here.
6::50::50::Considering it as my duty to relieve you both from the frightful bondage of snakes I reached. Do not be inattentive and guileless.
6::50::51::Rakshasas by nature use tricks in war. For noble people with good nature guilelessness is strength.
6::50::52::Being so you should not trust Rakshasas. By this experience you know that Rakshasas are crooked.
6::50::53::Having said so, Suparna endowed with mighty strength embraced Rama most affectionately and took leave of him.
6::50::54::My dear friend! I wish to take leave of you. Truly you are knower of what is right, and you are dear even to an enemy.
6::50::55::Heroic Rama! No question about your curiosity about our friendship now. After winning the war you will recognize.
6::50::56::Lanka will be left with youngsters and the aged with your arrows. The enemy Ravana killed, you will recover Sita.
6::50::57::Having spoken to Rama in that manner, Suparna endowed with wind speed in flight embraced Rama and went around him as a mark of reverence and soared into the sky.
6::50::58::Thereafter the Vanara troops, seeing the Raghavas freed from anguish, roared like a lion, and lashed their tails.
6::50::59::Then the Vanaras played drums and even mridangams, blew conches and started jumping and leaping as before.
6::50::60::The Vanaras who can fight with trees, uprooted several trees expressing their capacity distinctly and breaking them, and cracking their fingers. Making loud noise in hundreds and thousands stood there.
6::50::61::Making a lot of noise, the Vanaras reached the gates of Lanka frightening night rangers and desiring to wage war.
6::50::62::Thundering sounds resembling heavy clouds making terrific sounds arose, as if universal destruction was taking place at midnight.।। इत्यार्षेवाल्मीकीयेश्रीमद्रामायणेआदिकाव्येयुद्धकाण्डेपञ्चाशस्सर्गः ।।This is the end of the fiftieth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
