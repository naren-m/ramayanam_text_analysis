6::49::1::Sugriva, the very powerful one and all the best of Vanaras stood immersed in sorrow surrounding the great sons of Dasaratha, who were lying on the ground bound by a network of arrows like serpents, sighing, bodies covered with blood.
6::49::2::In the meantime, Rama, although bound, being a man of fortitude established in spiritual discipline, returned to consciousness.
6::49::3::There after seeing the piteous countenance of his brother, bound, and injured, Rama lamented.
6::49::4::Of what purpose is my life when I behold my brother lying lifeless in war? What do I have with Sita? Or even with my life?
6::49::5::In a mortal world I can look for a woman like Sita but not possible to find a helpful and capable brother.
6::49::6::If Sumithra's dear son gets merged with the five elements, I will give up my life as the Vanaras are beholding.
6::49::7::What can I say to mother Kausalya, Kaikeyi and mother Sumithra waiting to see her son?
6::49::8::If I go to Ayodhya without him, how can I console Sumithra crying aloud like a female osprey?
6::49::9::How can I return bereft of Lakshmana who went with me to the forest? What can I tell Satrughna, also the Bharata of great fame?
6::49::10::If Sumithra asks me, I can't endure. I cannot bear it. I shall give up my body, my life here itself.
6::49::11::What a pity! Me of sinful deeds and not a noble one, because of whose action Lakshmana's life having departed and lying on the bed of arrows.
6::49::12::You were always comforting me when I was sad. Now however much I am grieved, ceased of life you cannot comfort me.
6::49::13::You, who have struck down many Rakshasas in war, are lying unconscious on the same ground struck by arrows.
6::49::14::Lying on the bed of arrows in the network of arrows, blood flowing out from the body he remains shining like the setting sun.
6::49::15::Struck in the vital parts by the arrows, it is not possible for you to speak, but your anguish is indicated in your looks.
6::49::16::This Lakshmana glowing in brightness, travelled with me following me in the forest. In the same way I shall follow him to the abode of death.
6::49::17::He who was liked by relatives, was following ignoble me ever devoutly has reached this state.
6::49::18::Indeed, heroic Lakshmana never uttered an unpalatable word. I do not remember him speaking harsh words even when he was deeply provoked.
6::49::19::He who, in one go released five hundred arrows (with two hand s) is therefore superior to Kartaveerya (with thousand hands) releasing the same arrows.
6::49::20::He, who could destroy Indra's arrows also deserves to be on Indra's bed, is lying on the ground, killed.
6::49::21::I have not made Vibheeshana as the king of Rakshasas. Because of that untruth utterance they want to consume me, no doubt.
6::49::22::Sugriva! You return back from here now. Strong Ravana will chase you because of my not being here.
6::49::23::Sugriva! Return back from here along with the army keeping Angada in front, even Neela and Nala. Cross the ocean.
6::49::24::O King of Bears! King of Golangulas! Difficult action has been done by you and others in war. I am pleased with Hanumantha's action.
6::49::25::Formidable war was done by Angada, Mainda, Dwivida, and by all the Vanaras, Kesari and Sampathi.
6::49::26::Gava, Gavaksha, Sarabha and others even Vanaras have done war sacrificing their lives for me.
6::49::27::Sugriva! It is not possible for human beings to overcome God (destiny). O scorcher of enemies! Sugriva, my best friend, you have all done righteously that which is not possible.
6::49::28::O Bulls among Vanaras! All of you should go permitted by me. You have done friend's work. You may go where you wish to go. I permit said Rama.
6::49::29::All the Vanaras started shedding tears from their tawny eyes on listening to the lamentation of Rama.
6::49::30::Thereafter, Vibheeshana, settling all the army, hastened to reach Raghava with a mace.
6::49::31::Seeing Vibheeshana resembling a dark mountain, thinking him to be Indrajith, all the Vanaras ran from there.।। इत्यार्षेवाल्मीकीयेश्रीमद्रामायणेआदिकाव्येयुद्धकाण्डेएकोनपञ्चाशस्सर्गः ।।This is the end of the forty ninth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
