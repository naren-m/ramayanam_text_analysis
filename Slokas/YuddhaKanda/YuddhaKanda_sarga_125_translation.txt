6::125::4::Let all the forest rangers (without exception) who made effort and fought be duly honoured with valuables and several luxuries.
6::125::5::This Lanka could be won with the help of these heroes who never turned back and fought in comb at without fear of life, O Lord of Rakshasas.
6::125::6::These forest rangers, all of them have struggled and accomplished success. Reward them with wealth and gems.
6::125::7::These helpless monkey troops will be content with gratitude when rewarded, O respectable Vibheeshana.
6::125::8::If you do so you will be called as charitable and kind, not seizing wealth and as one who has gained over senses. That is why I am telling you for so long.
6::125::9::O Ruler of men, all the army will desert a king who is devoid of virtues, lowly and who is a destructor in the battlefield.
6::125::10::Vibheeshana honoured the Vanaras with gems and valuables, after Rama had spoken like that.

6::125::14::Bull among Vanaras! Since this work of the friend has been accomplished, you too have my permission to go where you will.
6::125::15::All that has to be done by an affectionate friend in advanced age has been done, for the fear of unrighteousness. Now you may advance with your army to Kishkinda.
6::125::16::Vibheeshana, I would like to see you living like Indra bestowed with your own kingdom in Lanka. It will not be possible for even gods to attack you.
6::125::17::I shall proceed to my father's capital, Ayodhya. You may permit me. Be auspicious. I take leave of you.
6::125::18::After Rama had spoken that way Sugriva, Vibheeshana, monkeys and Rakshasas saluted Rama and said as follows.
6::125::19::We wish to proceed with you to Ayodhya, and many wishes to go with you and range the forests and groves without anxiety.
6::125::20::O Jewel among kings! We will see you being consecrated and see Kausalya, greet her and return back to our own house.
6::125::21::Vibheeshana and Vanaras had spoken in that way, Rama replied to Sugriva, Vibheeshana and Vanaras as follows.
6::125::22::If I with my dear and near and together with you go to Ayodhya, that will give more happiness with Sita coming and with all of you.
