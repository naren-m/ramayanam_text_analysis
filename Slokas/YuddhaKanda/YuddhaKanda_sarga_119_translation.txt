6::119::1::Vaidehi heard the harsh horripilating words spoken by Rama in anger and was very much afflicted.
6::119::2::Then Mythili hearing her husband 's harsh words, in the presence of a large number of people, stayed bent with shyness.
6::119::3::As if pierced by those arrowlike words, Janaka's daughter shed tears excessively, shrinking into her own limbs.
6::119::4::Thereafter, wiping her face clean from flowing tears she spoke slowly in a choked voice in broken words to her husband.
6::119::5::Hero! Why are you addressing me in such harsh unkind words in a rude manner, in a harsh tone like a common man?
6::119::6::O Mighty armed! I am not as you think of me, so also show me a proof of it in my past. I swear on my past.
6::119::7::You give up judging all womankind by the path followed by vulgar women. You give up these doubts if you have examined.
6::119::8::O Lord! I was helpless when Ravana contacted my limbs in the past. I was not acting according to my will. My fate is to be blamed and not me.
6::119::9::That mind which is under my control is my heart and it abides in you. What can I do about my limbs when I am at others' mercy?
6::119::10::Honourable Rama! If I am not understood by you despite our growing up together with love and in spite of our intimate relationship, I am done forever.
6::119::11::King! When the great hero Hanuman was sent by you to find me in Lanka, why did you not leave me then.
6::119::12::O hero! Had you given me up immediately on receiving your message from Vanara I would have given up my life in the presence of Hanuman there itself.
6::119::13::O Life! If you had a doubt this exertion to you is wasteful. This fruitless hard work was perhaps not required on your part nor your friends.
6::119::14::O tiger among kings! You also gave up yourself to anger like a weak man and adopted womanliness
6::119::15::
6::119::16::When in my young age you held my hand as a mark of acceptance (in our marriage), has it not been considered by you? Has my devotion, character and chastity not been taken into account?
6::119::17::Thus speaking, and weeping with tears, with choked throat, Sita was absorbed in her mind and piteous. She spoke to Lakshmana.
6::119::18::Saumithri! Cure for this sorrow is only pyre. Arrange for pyre as I do not desire to live with false reproaches.
6::119::19::When my husband is not pleased with my virtues, renounces me in the gathering of people, I have only that path for me, that is, entering fire and offering myself as oblation.
6::119::20::Spoken in that manner by Vaidehi, Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemies, overcome with indignation looked at Raghava.
6::119::21::Understanding Rama's indication from his looks, Saumithri started to prepare the earth for pyre.
6::119::22::Indeed, no friend or dear could see or speak or make a request or pacify Rama. at that time.
6::119::23::Thereafter, Vaidehi, walking clockwise near Rama went round him in accordance with tradition and approached the pyre.
6::119::24::Mythili greeted the gods and brahmanas with joined palms and went near fire and again joined her palms in greeting and spoke as follows.
6::119::25::If it is true that my heart has never slid from Raghava at all, may the fire god protect me always and so also the world witness.
6::119::26::If in Rama's view, I am of impeccable conduct and so also if what he is seeing is not known to be true, let the world witness and fire god protect me.
6::119::27::'If I have ever acted or been unfaithful at heart or in speech and did not follow a righteous path with Rama, who is a knower of all virtues, let the fire god protect me.
6::119::28::O gods! Supreme Aditya, wind god, god of the four quarters, and also by moon, and gods presiding during day, night, twilight and so also earth, know me as a woman of good character, let the fire god protect me that way.
6::119::29::Having spoken in that way, Vaidehi went round fire fearlessly, absorbed with in herself and entered the flaming and burning fire.
6::119::30::Young and old assembled there, and the gathering of people witnessed Mythili entering the flaming and burning fire.
6::119::31::Like freshly polished gold, like shining gold ornament, in the presence of the whole world she fell into flaming and glowing fire.
6::119::32::All created beings and forms witnessed large eyed Sita descending on the golden altar, into the fire like goddess of fortune descending on her vehicle.
6::119::33::All the three worlds witnessed noble dark Sita entering the fire, like ghee offered to fire.
6::119::34::All the women who stood there fled, screaming on seeing Sita falling into fire, like the flow of ghee poured continuously into sacrificial fire reciting sacred verses by priests.
6::119::35::All the Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas of the three worlds who witnessed her falling, extolled her as if goddess was falling from heaven into hell.
6::119::36::While Sita was entering the fire the Rakshasas and the Vanaras made loud noises saying, 'Ha Ha wonderful'.।। इत्यार्षेवाल्मीकीयेश्रीमद्रामायणेदिकाव्येयुद्धकाण्डेएकोनविंशत्युत्तरशततमस्सर्गः ।।This is the end of one hundred and nineteenth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
