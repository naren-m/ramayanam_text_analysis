6::111::1::Matali reminded Rama in this way, O heroic Rama, why are you doing this way, as if you do not know?
6::111::2::O king! As spoken by Suras, the destruction of Ravana has come now. Use the missile of the creator Brahma.
6::111::3::Suggested and reminded by Matali, valiant Sri Rama seized hold of the wonderful glowing arrow, bestowed by Brahma, and given by the divine to sage Agastya first. Breathing heavily, like a serpent, Rama seized the arrow.
6::111::4::Earlier, this powerful arrow was created for Indra's sake by Brahma and was bestowed to Indra, the king of gods, who was desirous of conquering the three worlds.
6::111::5::The wind god presided over its feathers, the fire god and the Sun god presided over its head, its energy was presided over by Meru and Mandara mountains and its weight by the sky.
6::111::6::Its form was shining with feathers, decked with gold, splendid with all elements and brilliant like the sun.
6::111::7::Like fire at the time of dissolution of the universe, burning like venomous serpent, capable of splitting hosts of enemy, men, elephants, and horses and quick in action.
6::111::8::Capable of splitting gateways, iron bars, even mountains, smeared with blood and brain marrow of various Asuras, of dreadful appearance.
6::111::9::Strong as thunderbolt, loud sounding, dispersing every deceitful kind of army, frightening to all kinds of beings, hissing like a serpent.
6::111::10::In war, it provides food for buzzards, vultures, and herons, and also jackals and Rakshasas, causing terror in the form of Yama (God of death).
6::111::11::Provides delight for Vanara chiefs, causes destruction of Rakshasas, provides picturesque plumes of eagles to arrows.
6::111::12::The great arrow, was a dispeller of fear of enemies to Ikshvaku kings, which takes away the glory of enemies, delighting to oneself, chanting vedas as per tradition, charging with mystic power, mighty strong Rama fitted to the bow.
6::111::13::As Raghava started fixing his excellent arrow, all beings got terrified and the earth shook.
6::111::14::Rama, provoked by anger, stretched the bow to full length, very well prepared, released the arrow on Ravana, which was capable of tearing into the vital parts.
6::111::15::Like the thunderbolt hurled by the arm of Indra, difficult to obstruct, capable of bringing life to an end, that arrow released by Rama penetrated into Ravana's chest.
6::111::16::Loosed at high velocity, that arrow capable of putting an end to the body, split as under the heart of evilminded Ravana
6::111::17::That arrow which was capable of putting an end to the body took out Ravana's life and smeared with blood, it entered the earth.
6::111::18::That arrow of Rama, on killing Ravana, soaked in blood, having accomplished the task quietly reentered its quiver.
6::111::19::Thus, when Ravana was killed and lost his life, the bow and arrow in his hand also fell along with his life breath.
6::111::20::The king of Rakshasas, who possessed terrific speed and courage, having lost life, fell on earth like Vrttra struck down by thunderbolt.
6::111::21::Seeing their Lord killed and fallen on the ground, the leftover night rangers fled all over in fear.
6::111::22::Seeing Ravana killed, the Vanaras holding trees went roaming on all sides, feeling triumphant.
6::111::23::The Rakshasas hurt by the Vanaras, lost battle and their king killed, were piteous and went towards Lanka in fear, eyes filled with tears.
6::111::24::Then the Vanaras, feeling triumphant, got highly excited over Rama's victory and the death of Ravana, and shouted aloud in joy.
6::111::25::And then thirty drums of gods sounded in the sky. Divine fragrant pleasant breeze blew.
6::111::26::Then from heaven, a very pleasing shower of flowers, difficult to know from where, fell on Raghava's chariot covering it and dropped on the ground.
6::111::27::The gods too praised Sri Rama, the great soul saying, 'Well done, Well done', from the heaven, which was distinctly heard.
6::111::28::When Ravana, a terror of all worlds was killed, the Charanas and Devas were filled with great joy.
6::111::29::The foremost of the Rakshasas killed, Raghava was pleased and having fulfilled the desire of Sugriva, Angada, Vibheeshana, he made them happy.
6::111::30::Then the host of gods attained tranquil, quarters brightened, sky became clear, earth no longer shook, wind blew and even the Sun became steady and radiant.
6::111::31::Then all of them (hosts of gods) coming together, accompanied by Lakshmana, Sugriva, Vibheeshana, and Angada along with other friends, happy about the victory in the battle offered prayers to charming Sri Rama in accordance with tradition.
6::111::32::Sri Rama, who was steadfast in his vow and endowed with great prowess, having killed his enemy, in the battle, stood, surrounded by his people and the army. Sri Rama the enhancer of joy of Raghus shone like Indra surrounded by host of gods.।। इत्यार्षेवाल्मीकीयेश्रीमद्रामायणेआदिकाव्येयुद्धकाण्डेएकादशोत्तरशततमस्सर्गः ।।This is the end of one hundred and eleventh sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by Sage Valmiki.
