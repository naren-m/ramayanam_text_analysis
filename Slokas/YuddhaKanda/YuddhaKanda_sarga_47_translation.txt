6::47::18::Janaka's daughter of beautiful limbs and dark eyes, seeing her husband and Lakshmana, both powerful ones rolling, roared aloud.
6::47::19::As tears were rolling down her eyes, beholding the brothers who were equal to gods in their glory, suspecting them to be dead Sita spoke these words।। इत्यार्षेवाल्मीकीयेश्रीमद्रामायणेआदिकाव्येयुद्धकाण्डेसप्तचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः ।।This is the end of the forty seventh sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
