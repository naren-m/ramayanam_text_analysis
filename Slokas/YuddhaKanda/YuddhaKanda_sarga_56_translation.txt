6::56::1::Observing the great action and accomplishment of the foremost Vanaras in the battle, Akampana exhibited violent anger.
6::56::2::Looking at the deeds of enemies, deluded with violent anger, Akampana spoke these words holding the bow and looking at the charioteer.
6::56::3::O Charioteer, quickly drive the chariot to that place where many Rakshasas are destroyed in the battle.
6::56::4::Those Vanaras are mighty and terribly angry. They are using trees and hillocks as weapons. Take me where chiefs are standing.
6::56::5::I wish to see the end of Vanaras who boast of their warfare. The entire Rakshasa army is destroyed by them.
6::56::6::Then Akampana seated in the chariot drawn by fast moving horses, assailed the Vanaras with a network of arrows.
6::56::7::The Vanaras could not counter or stand nor fight in battle. What to say more? Shattered by Akampana's arrows, they all took to their heels.
6::56::8::Having observed that Vanaras are fallen under the sway of Akampana and under the sway of death, mighty Hanuman approached Akampana.
6::56::9::Seeing the great monkey, the Vanara troops got together and surrounded him.
6::56::10::Seeing Hanuman, the monkey leaders took their shelter under him, got established firmly and became strong.
6::56::11::On Akampana, who was well established like a mountain, mighty Hanuman showered torrents of arrows like Indra showered rain.
6::56::12::Mighty Hanuman unmindful of the volley of arrows pierced in his body thought in his mind only about the destruction of Akampana.
6::56::13::Hanuman, the highly energetic son of Maruthi laughing, sprung up causing the earth to shake and rushed to that Rakshasa.
6::56::14::As he roared, his brilliance was blazing, his form was burning and became formidable for others to be at him.
6::56::15::Vanara leader himself knowing that he is without any weapon, full of anger took up a mountain quickly.
6::56::16::He, the heroic Maruthi, with one hand alone taking a huge mountain whirled round making loud noises.
6::56::17::Then he went to Akampana and tormented him just as Indra did with his thunderbolt to Namuchi.
6::56::18::Seeing the peak of the mountain uplifted, Akampana also discharged halfmoon shaped great arrows from a distance.
6::56::19::Hanuman seeing the peak of the mountain broken into pieces by Rakshasa's arrows and fallen was deluded with anger.
6::56::20::He (Hanuman) filled with pride and anger quickly uprooted an Aswakarana tree as huge as a mountain and held it.
6::56::21::He (Hanuman) endowed with great splendour, seizing a huge trunk of Aswakarana tree with great delight, whirled it round on the ground laughing.
6::56::22::Highly enraged Hanuman was running at high speed that his feet were seen breaking the trees and cleaving the earth.
6::56::23::Hanuman struck the mahouts, elephants, similarly the chariots and riders of chariots as well as the terrific Rakshasas who fought standing on feet.
6::56::24::Hanuman, enraged like the spirit of death, took their life (Rakshasas) armed with trees and on seeing him the Rakshasas took to their heels.
6::56::25::The heroic Akampana saw Hanuman coming towards him very angry. Fearing Hanuman, the Rakshasas ran roaring in fear.
6::56::26::With fourteen pointed powerful arrows, Akampana tormented and split the body of Hanuman.
6::56::27::Valiant Hanuman, even though interrupted several times with rain of arrows, stood still like a mountain full of trees.
6::56::28::The gigantic Hanuman, exceedingly valiant and courageous one shone like a fully blossomed Ashoka tree, resembled smokeless fire.
6::56::29::Then Hanuman performed another supreme deed by uprooting a tree and striking on the head of Akampana, the chief of Rakshasas.
6::56::30::Reacting in anger the great Vanara chief struck the Rakshasa with a tree, by which the Rakshasa fell down dead.
6::56::31::Seeing Akampana lying dead on the ground, the Rakshasas were shaken like the trees in the earthquake and were distressed.
6::56::32::Abandoning weapons, all Rakshasas having been defeated, chased by the Vanaras, frightened, ran away into Lanka.
6::56::33::Perplexed, broken hearted, defeated, hair loosened the Rakshasas sweating all over their limbs, sighing heavily ran away very fast.
6::56::34::Again, and again looking back in fear, covertly, bewildered, crushing one another, they went into the Lanka city.
6::56::35::Those Rakshasas, endowed with prowess, on entering Lanka got together and paid respects to Hanuman.
6::56::36::Hanuman also who was richly endowed with goodness greatly honoured all the Vanaras accordingly.
6::56::37::In an atmosphere of triumph, the monkeys sportively shouted again saying that they are willing to give up their life also.
6::56::38::Great Vanara, Maruti shone like a triumphant hero and saviour in front of the army, just as Lord Vishnu, the Lord of Devatas shone after killing the foes (demons).
6::56::39::Thereafter Rama with the army of Devatas, Atibala and Lakshmana, in the same way Sugriva, the army chief, so also, Vibheeshana of exceeding might praised Hanuman.।। इत्यार्षेवाल्मीकीयेश्रीमद्रामायणेआदिकाव्येयुद्धकाण्डेषटपञ्चाशस्सर्गः ।।This is the end of the fifty sixth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
