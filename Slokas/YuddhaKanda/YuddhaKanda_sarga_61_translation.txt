6::61::1::On taking up a bow Rama saw Kumbhakarna of extraordinary energy, prodigious, and of large body, adorned with a crown.
6::61::2::That foremost of Rakshasas was like a mountain in appearance, it was like Lord Narayana taking steps to the sky earlier.
6::61::3::Seeing the Rakshasa who was like a rainy cloud with water, decked with gold ornaments, the commander in chief of Vanaras ran.
6::61::4::Seeing the army scared away and the army of Rakshasas growing in size, Rama was astonished and thus spoke to Vibheeshana.
6::61::5::Who is that hero resembling a mountain, a crowned one with tawny eyes, looking like a rainy cloud driven by lightning? He is seen in Lanka.
6::61::6::He is seen here like a lone comet on earth. Seeing him the Vanaras are fleeing hither and thither.
6::61::7::Who is he, that gigantic Rakshasa? Is he a demon or perhaps a colossus? No such being was seen by me earlier.
6::61::8::Asked by the prince Rama, of unwearied action, highly intelligent Vibheeshana spoke.
6::61::9::Vyvasvatha (Lord of death) as well as Vasava (Indra) were defeated by him in war. He is Kumbhakarna, the son of sage Visrava, a stupendous one and there is no other Rakshasa who equals him in size.
6::61::10::O Raghava! In war Devas, Danavas, Yakshas, Nagas, ogres, Gandharvas, Vidydharas, Kinneras in thousands were defeated by him.
6::61::11::This Kumbhakarna with pike in hand and fierce eyes, is mighty strong. All the Devatas could not kill him, deluded that he is death personified.
6::61::12::Kumbhakarna is by nature (by birth) energetic and mighty. The strength of other Rakshasas is on account of their boons received by them.
6::61::13:: As soon as he was born, he was hungry and this great soul being strong consumed thousands of created beings.
6::61::14::In that way when Kumbhakarna was devouring, out of fear all people sought the refuge of Indra and represented.
6::61::15::Mahendra who was armed with thunderbolt got enraged and hurt Kumbhakarna with thunderbolt. He reeled and roared with the strike.
6::61::16::People were already afraid of Kumbhakarna, and after hearing the lion roar of this Rakshasa they were even more scared.
6::61::17::Then mighty Kumbhakarna, who was enraged, pulled out the tusk of Airavatham and struck at the chest of Indra.
6::61::18::Hit by Kumbhakarna Indra felt tormented. The Devatas, Brahmarshis and Danavas became despondent. Accompanied by created beings they complained to Brahma.
6::61::19::They reported to Brahma about Kumbhakarna's ruthless deeds, devouring created beings, insulting, harsh and also destroying the abodes of sages violently and abducting others' wives.
6::61::20::If he consumes created beings every day like that, in the course of time the world will be devoid of beings.
6::61::21::Hearing the words of Indra, Brahma conjured the Rakshasas and saw Kumbhakarna with them.
6::61::22::Beholding Kumbhakarna, Brahma was alarmed and spoke to him to restore the confidence of Kumbhakarna.
6::61::23::Surely you are begotten by Paulastya for the destruction of the universe. Therefore, remain sleeping like a dead one from today, ' said Brahma and cursed him.
6::61::24::Thereafter, by the curse of Lord Brahma, Kumbhakarna fell in front. Highly agitated at this Ravana spoke these words to Brahma.
6::61::25::Oh Brahma! Cutting a golden tree at the stage of fruiting is not fair. It is not proper for you to curse your great grandson in that way.
6::61::26::Your words will not become untrue, no doubt. Sleep, he must but waking time may be fixed.
6::61::27::On hearing Ravana's words, Brahma said He will sleep for six months and stay awake for a day.
6::61::28::This hero will open his mouth wide and move about and alone he will consume the world like the swollen fire.
6::61::29::Overtaken by worry, the king out of fear of your prowess just awakened sleeping Kumbhakarna.
6::61::30::This heroic Kumbhakarna has come out of his residence extremely angry and going to and from to consume all Vanaras.
6::61::31::On merely seeing Kumbhakarna, the monkeys are running away. How will they check him who is enraged in war?
6::61::32::Let all the Vanaras be told, that this one standing high is a machine then the Vanaras will not be scared of victory.
6::61::33::Hearing the words of Vibheeshana, which was reasonable and, in their favour, Raghava said this to Nila, the commander in chief of the army.
6::61::34::Pavaka, go and organize all the army and get together to occupy all the gates, highways, bridges in Lanka.
6::61::35::Be ready staying on mountain tops, trees, rocks armed with weapons and rocks in hand.
6::61::36::As instructed by Raghava, the monkey leader Nila, elephant among the monkeys, ordered the monkey troops as instructed.
6::61::37::Then taking mountains, Gavaksha, Sarabha, Hanuman, Angada who looked like mountains themselves marched to the gate.
6::61::38::The monkeys desiring to be triumphant, took trees and began to strike at the enemies on hearing Rama's control.
6::61::39::Then Vanaras taking trees and mountains in their shining hand s marching close to each other seemed like a huge mass of terrible clouds hanging close to a mountain.।।इत्यार्षेवाल्मीकीयेश्रीमद्रामायणेआदिकाव्येयुद्धकाण्डेषष्टितमस्सर्गः ।।This is the end of the sixty first sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
