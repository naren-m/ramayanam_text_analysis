6::79::1::On seeing Maka raksha all the Vanara chiefs returned, jumped, and stood ready enthusiastically to fight.

6::79::3::Then monkeys as well as Rakshasas fought hurling trees and pikes and bringing down rocks and clubs physically hurting each other.
6::79::4::Those prowlers, then ight rangers discharging javelins, swords, maces, spears, lances, small swords, bhindi Palas, shafts, nooses, mallets and staff and other weapons on the lions among the monkeys, caused destruction.
6::79::5::Vanaras perturbed terribly by the volley of arrows of Khara's son were stricken with fear and ran.
6::79::6::The monkeys saw all the arrogant Rakshasas roaring like lions and running as though triumphed.
6::79::7::Thereafter, seeing the Vanaras running all over, Rama stopped the Rakshasas by rain of arrows.
6::79::8::Seeing the intercepted Rakshasas, the night ranger Maka raksha was overtaken by fire of anger spoke these words.
6::79::9::Rama Stop. Duel will take place with me. I will give you sharpened arrows from my bow and relieve you of your life.
6::79::10::Then in Dandakaranya my father was killed. Now for the samereason you are in front of me. Seeing you my anger is increasing.
6::79::11::O Evil minded Raghava! at that time, I did not see you in D and aka forest. My limbs are burning in anger.
6::79::12::Rama! To my good fortune it became possible for me to see you here. Just as a hungry lion waits for an animal, I am waiting for you.
6::79::13::Now by the speed of my arrow I will send you totherealm of Yama and there you will be along with the demons killed by you.
6::79::14::Rama, why talk so much? Listen to my words. Let people in all worldssee you and me in the battlefield.
6::79::15::By weapons, or by mace or else with hand s or any other weapon or with your military practice, you fight, he said to Rama.
6::79::16::Laughing at the words of Maka raksha who was speaking again and again Rama said.
6::79::17::Rakshasa! Why so much of wasteful talk about What you can't accomplish? Victory is not possible on the battlefield with your force of speech
6::79::18::In Dandaka, fourteen thousand Rakshasas, your father, Trisira, and also Dooshana were killed by me alone.
6::79::19::O Sinner! Today vultures, jackals and crows with sharp beaks and goads like claws will also be satiated with your flesh.
6::79::20::Spoken in that manner by Raghava in the battlefield, Maka raksha, endowed with extraordinary strength, released a volley of arrows on Rama.
6::79::21::Rama rained volley of arrows on the Rakshasa and shattered those golden feathered arrows which fell on the ground into thousands of pieces.
6::79::22::On meeting one another between Khara's son and Dasharatha's son a fierce comb at happened.
6::79::23::Then the sound released by the friction of the bowstring and the hand (of the two heroes) filled the sky like thunder of clouds.
6::79::24::Devas, Danavas, Ghand arvas, Kinnaras and huge serpents all of them stood in space to look at the wonderful evil deed.
6::79::25::Even though they were piercing one another with limbs, their strength remained doubled in the battlefield. Each of them was countering the other and inflicting and hitting each other.
6::79::26::In the comb at Rakshasa split the arrows released by Rama and Rakshasa shattered the arrows released by Rama.
6::79::27::All quarters were covered by the arrows in that manner all over and even the intermediate point, the earth could not be seen.
6::79::28::Then broad shouldered Raghava was enraged and split the bow with eight steel arrows and the charioteer also.
6::79::29::Rama broke the chariot, killed the horses, and laid down the night ranger Maka raksha. Deprived of the chariot he stood on the ground.
6::79::30::Standing on the ground that Rakshasa who created fear among all beings shone like fire at the time of dissolution of the universe, seized his pike in hand.
6::79::31::Seeing that pike, which was glowing like flame, by which the quarters were glowing brightly in the sky like the flame, which had been given by Rudra, which caused fear like another weapon of destruction, all gods fled in panic in all directions.
6::79::32::The night ranger whirling round and round the glowing pike furiously hurled at Raghava in that conflict.
6::79::33::Raghava split with his three arrows the burning pike released from the hand of Khara's son while it was still flying in the sky.
6::79::34::That pike, which was decorated with gold, broke into pieces, and fell down like fire sticks by the many supreme arrows of Rama.
6::79::35::Seeing the unwearied action of Raghava in destroying the pike, the beings in the sky praised him saying, well done, well done.
6::79::36::The night ranger Makaraksha seeing his pike destroyed lifting up his fist said this to Kakuthsa, Wait, wait.
6::79::37::Then Rama the beloved of Raghus, laughing at Maka raksha, fixed missile presided by fire god.
6::79::38::Then struck in the battlefield by that missile of Kakuthsa, the Rakshasa fell down with his heart split open and died.
6::79::39::Seeing Maka raksha fall, those Rakshasas became scared of Rama's arrow and ran straight to Lanka.
