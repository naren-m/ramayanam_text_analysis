3::42::27::Seeing the deer, other animals wandering in the forest come near and sniffing him run away in all ten directions.
3::42::28::The demon who was interested in killing wild deer touched and felt them but did not kill or feed on them in order to hide his intention.
3::42::29::In the mean time Sita who, with her auspicious looks, was busy plucking flowers drew near the trees.
3::42::30::With her bewitching eyes and beautiful face, Sita, went about plucking flowers from karnikara, ashoka and mango trees.
