3::40::1::The demon Ravana did not heed the appropriate advice of the competent Maricha just like a man wishing to die refuses medicine.
3::40::2::The king of the demons, driven by fate, replied with improper and harsh words to Maricha whose advice was salutary and beneficial to him :
3::40::3::O Maricha, the words addressed to me are not appropriate.Your advice is extremely fruitless like a seed sown in saline, barren soil.
3::40::4::It is not possible to dissuade me from my encounter with Rama who is sinful, foolish and especially an ordinary human being.
3::40::5::On hearing the casual words of a woman, (this) Rama came to the forest at once, leaving his friends, kingdom, mother and father.
3::40::6::In your very presence I will surely abduct Sita, wife of Rama who killed Khara in war, Sita whom he loves more than his life. 
3::40::7::O Maricha  I have made up my mind that way. Even demons or deities including Indra cannot alter this decision of mine.
3::40::8::If I asked you the merits or demerits, the risks involved or the way out while deciding a case, you should have said what you did.
3::40::9::A wise counsellor should give advice to the king only when his opinion is sought and that too with folded hands, if he wishes his own prosperity.
3::40::10::A king should be addressed with politeness and decorum, with words not unfavourble intended for his good luck and wellbeing.
3::40::11::A king who deserves honour does not feel happy to hear even good words of advice if said in disrespectful or authoritarian way, O Maricha 
3::40::12::Very powerful kings assume five forms like fire, Indra, Moon, Varuna and Yama.
3::40::13::Great kings possess heat, (of the firegod), valour (of Indra), coolness (of the Moon), command (of Varuna) and grace (of the Lord of death). Therefore kings at all stages deserve respect and reverence.
3::40::14::You do not know your rightful duty.Because of delusion and an evil mind, you want to speak only harsh words to me, a guest who has come to you.
3::40::15::O demon  O extremely valiant demon  I ask you(to do) this much now. I am not asking you whether it is good or bad or whether it is for my welfare or not.
3::40::16::You have to help me in accomplishing this great task .Hear me on the kind of work you have to do.
3::40::17::Missing
3::40::18::Transform yourself into a wonderful golden deer with silver spots and move about in front of Sita at the hermitage of Rama. After fascinating her, you may go whereever you desire.
3::40::19::Seeing the illusory golden deer, Sita, wonderstruck, will at once ask Rama to get the deer.
3::40::20::Divert Rama to a faroff place and cry, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana',  imitating the voice of Rama. 
3::40::21::On hearing you, Lakshmana will be bewildered. Urged by Sita and out of love for Rama, Lakshmana will follow the same track as Rama. 
3::40::22::When Rama and Lakshmana are away I will comfortably abduct Vaidehi like the thousandeyed Indra brought Sachi.
3::40::23::You may go wherever you want after accomplishing this task. I will give you, O demon of determination half my kingdom.
3::40::24::Go and accomplish this task. Let your path be auspicious. I will follow you on the chariot into the Dandaka forest.
3::40::25::I will deceive Rama and obtain Sita, without waging a war. With the work done, I will return to Lanka along with you.
3::40::26::O Maricha if you do not do this, I will kill you now. Or, by force make you do this work. No one who goes against the king lives in comfort.
3::40::27::Your survival is doubtful after facing Rama in combat. But your death is certain if you oppose me now. Think carefuly and do whatever is desirable for you in the present circumstances.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
