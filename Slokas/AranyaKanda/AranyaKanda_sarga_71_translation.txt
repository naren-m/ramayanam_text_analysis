3::71::1::O longarmed, mighty and powerful Rama in the past I was handsome like the Moon or Indra or the Sun inconceivable to all the three worlds.
3::71::2::With my appearance, I was a great nuisance to the world and used to terrorise the sages living in the forest.
3::71::3::With my appearance I invited the wrath of Sthulasira who I assaulted among the many seers, while he was collecting food in the forest.
3::71::4::Seeing me he pronounced a dreadful curse on me saying, 'You will get a cruel, despicable form.' 
3::71::5::When I sought to know how the curse angrily pronounced on me would come to an end, he said:
3::71::6:: 'When Rama gets your arms in a desolate forest amputated and your body cremated, you would get back your gloriously auspicious form.'
3::71::7::O Lakshmana know that I was the prosperous son of demon Danu. By the wrath of Indra in the battlefeild I obtained this form.
3::71::8::I pleased the creator Brahma with great penance. He blessed me with long life. Then this pride and confusion overtook me.
3::71::9::Having been blessed with long life and thinking, what can Indra do to me?, I attacked him. 
3::71::10::The thunderbolt having a hundred nodes deployed by Indra pierced my thighs and my head.
3::71::11::Entreated, he did not send me to the abode of Yama ( lord of death) and said, 'Let the words of the creator be true' .
3::71::12::Hit by the thunderbolt, my thighbones, head and face were broken. Somehow I could manage to live for a long time without food. 
3::71::13::Having been entreated, Indra created in me two long arms extending upto a yojana and set my mouth with sharp teeth in the stomach.
3::71::14::Stretching the long arms in the forest, I dragged creatures like lions, tigers, elephants and deer moving in the forest and ate them.
3::71::15::Indra too had said, 'When Rama along with Lakshmana cuts off your arms in a fight,  you would reach heaven.'
3::71::16::O Rama, the best of kings I thought it was only proper in this forest and with this body to catch whatever creature I saw.
3::71::17::O Rama, I was struggling to preserve my body all the time thinking that some day you would certainly come into my arms.
3::71::18::You are that Rama. Be blessed. As stated by the seer I cannot be really killed by any one except you.
3::71::19::O best among men I will help you with my wisdom and give you friendly advice when I am purified by you both through cremation on the funeral pyre.
3::71::20::Rigteous Rama spoke the following words in response to the story of Danu within Lakshmana's earshot:
3::71::21::My illlustrious wife Sita was carried away by Ravana comfortably when I was away from Janasthana along with my brother.
3::71::22::I only know his name. We do not know how he looks, where he lives and what influence he has.
3::71::23::Creatures like you may help those who, like orphans, run here and there, stricken with sorrow.
3::71::24::O hero we will cremate you in a huge pit to be prepared for this occasion, collecting dry logs of wood broken by elephants.
3::71::25:: If you really know where SIta has been kidnapped and by whom, tell me. You will be doing a great service.
3::71::26::Danu who was proficient in speech spoke with chosen words to Rama who was a great speaker himself:
3::71::27::I do not have divine wisdom (now). Nor do I know Sita. When you cremate me, I shall assume my original form and will tell you the name of the person who knows it.
3::71::28::O lord before I am cremated, I do not have the ability to know  about that powerful demon by whom Sita has been abducted. 
3::71::29::O Rama due to the curse I have lost my wisdom. By my own deed, I have attained this form despicable to the world.
3::71::30::Before the Sun  disappears with his tired horses drop me into a pit and cremate me in accordance with tradition, O Rama 
3::71::31::O heroic Rama, delight of the Raghus, if you drop me in a pit and cremate me as per custom, I will tell you about him who knows the demon.
3::71::32::O Rama you should establish friendship with him in a just manner. That hero of swift action will help you when he is pleased.
3::71::33::O Rama, there is nothing that he does not know in the three worlds. In the past for a different reason he roamed all the (three) worlds.इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
