4::11::1::The words of Rama boosted Sugriva's joy and manliness. He offered him prayers and praise:
4::11::2::'There is no doubt that your sharp, blazing arrows will pierce through the vital parts of the body once you are angry, just as the Sungod burns all worlds at the end of the Yuga.
4::11::3::
4::11::4::'In the early hours before Sunrise Vali crosses over the oceans from the west to the east and moving from south to north (performing sandhya) without getting fatigued.
4::11::5::'Climbing up speedily, valiant Vali would catch the huge mountain peaks. 
4::11::6::'Vali would break several sturdy trees in the forest with his vigour and speed, exhibiting his strength.
4::11::7::'Massive like the shining peak of mount Kailas and valiant like the mightybuffalo in form, Dundubhi possessed the strength of a thousand elephants.
4::11::8::'Wicked Dundubhi of huge body was proud of his valour and deluded by virtue of the boons, went to the ocean, the lord of rivers.
4::11::9::'Reaching the mighty ocean, he implored the sea with (high) waves and hoards of gems for a fight.
4::11::10::'O king, then the powerful and righteous king of the ocean came out and spoke to the demon (Dundubhi) who was driven to death by fate.' 
4::11::11::'You are proficient in warfare. I am not competent enough to challenge you to a duel. But  I will name the one who can.
4::11::12::'Himavan, the supreme abode of ascetics is the fatherinlaw of Lord Siva. He is wellknown as king of mountains, who has, waterfalls, caves, caverns and great forests.He is competent to match your incomparable love for war.
4::11::13::'Dundubhi, the most powerful of demons, aware that the ocean is frightened of him went swiftly to Himavan like an arrow released from a bow. He raised many huge white cliffs of the size of great elephants to the ground and roared.
4::11::14::'Then the gentle Himavan of pleasing appearance stood in the form of a white cloud on the peak and spoke:
4::11::15::'Dundubhi, it is not proper for you to trouble me, for I am devoted to righteousness. I am the resort of ascetics and not adept in warfare'. 
4::11::16::
4::11::17::'If you are unable or unwilling to fight me out of fear, tell me who wants to challenge me to a duel.
4::11::18::'On hearing such words, which no one had spoken earlier, righteous Himavan, skilful in conversation, flew into a rage and said to Dundubhi,the best of demons:
4::11::19::'Vali, son of Indra, is a wise, powerful and prosperous monkey. He resides at Kishkinda, a city of incomparable glory.
4::11::20::'Vali is profoundly wise, an expert in warfare. He is capable of challenging you to a duel like Indra to Namuchi.
4::11::21::'If you wish to fight, go to him quickly.He is ever heroic and difficult to combat.
4::11::22::'Having heard Himavan, Dundubhi, seized with anger, went to Kishkindha,  the city of Vali.
4::11::23::'Mighty Dundubhi assuming the form of a frightening buffalo with pointed horns looking like a huge, dark raincloud in the sky in monsoon marched to the entrance of Kishkinda and roared like a wardrum as if shaking the earth.
4::11::24::'Dundubhi felled the trees nearby, rent the earth with its hoofs, scratched the entrance gate of the city as an elephant would do with its horns in arrogance.
4::11::25::'Unable to tolerate the sound, Vali jumped out of the harem along with the women like the Moon with stars.
4::11::26::'Vali, king of the monkeys who roam the forest, saw Dundubhi and addressed, but briefly:
4::11::27::'O Dundubhi why are you roaring, blocking the entrance of the city? I know you are powerful. Go and save your life.'
4::11::28::'Dundubhi whose eyes turned red in anger when he heard the words of Vali ,the wise king of the monkeys, said:
4::11::29::'O hero speaking such words in the presence of women is not proper. Come to me for a combat and I will let you know your strength.  
4::11::30::'O monkey I will restrain my anger tonight and give you time for your indulgence in sensual pleasures till morning.
4::11::31::'O king of monkeys, hug them and give them any gift you want. Spend the night with your dear ones.
4::11::32::'Have a good look a Kishkinda. Assign some one like you kingship. Sport freely  with women and come, I shall destroy your arrogance. 
4::11::33::'Whoever kills a person, who is drunk or is heedless or is asleep or without weapons or stupified by lust in this world, is equal to a killer of a foetus in the womb.'
4::11::34::'Then, Vali sent away Tara and all other women slowly and replied angrily to the foolish demon with a mischievous smile:
4::11::35::'Do not consider me drunken. This drink will serve as a warrior's drink in the combat. Be ready, if you are not afraid of a combat.'
4::11::36::'Having addressed thus in a rage, Vali removed the golden garland gifted by Indra, his father, and stood ready for the combat.
4::11::37::'Vali, the elephantlike monkey then held the mountainlike Dundubhi by the horns and struck him down, roaring loudly.
4::11::38::'Vali whirled him round and round and threw him downroaring. Blood flowed from Dundubhi's ears.
4::11::39::'Each one of them was highly agitated and angry trying to win over the other. A terrific fight took place between Dundubhi and Vali.
4::11::40::'Then Vali who was equal to Indra in prowess fought, hitting him with fists, knees, rocks and trees.
4::11::41::'Then as the monkey and demon fought pouncing on each other, the prowess of Dundubhi got diminished and that of Vali, the son of Indra, increased.
4::11::42::In the fight, Dundubhi fell down, with his strength, courage and prowess dwindled. Vali lifted his huge body and dashed it down on the ground. The body of Dundubhi dissolved into the five elements.  
4::11::43::'Mighty Vali lifted on both shoulders the insensate body drained of life and hurled it speedily to a distance of a yojana.
4::11::44::'Scattered by the wind, drops of blood fell at the hermitage of Matanga from the mouth of the deadbody flung. 
4::11::45::'The venerable sage became furious to see drops of blood fallen there. He started thinking who could he be?
4::11::46::'Who is that petty, wicked, evil minded one who caused the drops of blood to touch (fall on) me suddenly?
4::11::47::'The venerable sage came out of the hermitage and saw a mountaneous buffalo fallen dead on the floor.
4::11::48::'Having known through his ascetic vision that it was the act of a monkey, he pronounced a curse on Vali who had hurled (the body):
4::11::49::'Whoever has desecrated this forest, protected by me, with drops of blood is forbidden to enter this place. Once he does it, he will die.
4::11::50::'Whoever has broken the trees all over this forest and has thrown the demon's body will not survive if he enters within a radius of one yojana  of my hermitage.
4::11::51::'Indeed his counsellors who are here must leave this forest. Let them depart safely.
4::11::52::'If the monkeys stay back to destroy the leaves and shoots and plunder the fruits and roots of this forest which I have protected just like my son will also certainly invite my curse.
4::11::53::'I give one day's time for the monkeys (to leave). Whomsoever, I see tomorrow will get transformed into a mountain for many thousands of years'
4::11::54::'The monkeys fled on hearing the words spoken by the sage. Said Vali:
4::11::55::'Why have you, residents of the groves of Matanga, come to me? Hope all are safe'
4::11::56::'Then all the monkeys collected together and narrated everything about the curse given to Vali , adorned with a golden chain(on his neck).
4::11::57::'On hearing the monkeys, Vali went to the sage and begged forgiveness with folded hands.
4::11::58::'The sage went into the hermitage without obliging Vali who became apprehensive of the curse of the sage.
4::11::59::'O Lord Rama because of the fear of the curse, Vali will not enter the great Rishyamuka mountain nor will he like to see it.
4::11::60::'O Rama aware of the prohibition of Vali from entering the place, I roam about this great forest  accompanied by my ministers without any apprehension.
4::11::61::'Hurled with the pride of his(Vali's) prowess is this heap of bones of Dundubhi here, which shines like a huge mountain peak.
4::11::62::'Look at these seven sturdy Sala trees with branches  of one overlapping the other.  Vali was able to remove all the leaves of one Sala tree with just one arrow.
4::11::63::'O Rama Vali's strength and fame related by me is unequalled. O king how is it possible for you to kill him in a combat?'
4::11::64::Smiling, Lakshmana asked Sugriva, 'By what action will you trust?. By the fulfilment of which task (by Rama) will you have faith?'
4::11::65::Then Sugriva told Lakshmana that earlier Vali had split through these seven Sala trees one after the other, several times.
4::11::66::'If I see Rama splitting these trees with one arrow, I will believe he can kill Vali with his prowess.
4::11::67::'O Lakshmana and if Rama can also lift the dead buffalo's (Dundubhi's) skeleton and hurl it to a distance  of two hundred bows with one of his feet.
4::11::68::Having said this and thinking for a moment, Sugriva again said to the heroic Rama whose eyes had turned red. 
4::11::69::'Powerful Vali is valiant and has killed brave fighters. He is wellknown for his prowess and valour. He has not faced defeat in war.
4::11::70::'Even gods cannot do what he has done. Thinking of all this and being afraid of him, I have taken refuge at Rishyamuka.
4::11::71::'Thinking that this indignant, invincible lord of the monkeys, cannot be overpowered, I have not stepped out of Rishyamuka.
4::11::72::
4::11::73::'I have discovered in you a faithful friend. O tiger among men, O venerable one, you are to me like the Himalayas.
4::11::74::'What to do? I know the strength of my mighty bad brother. But so far I have not seen your power in a battle.
4::11::75::'The dreadful acts of Vali have made me feel timid. This is not to compare you with him or your strength with his or insult you and scare you. 
4::11::76::'Rama  your word and your courage indicate your supreme strength which is like fire covered with ashes.'
4::11::77::Having heard the great Sugriva, Rama replied with a gentle smile:
4::11::78::'If you have no confidence in my strength in fight, O monkey, I will create it in you so much so that you will admire it.'
4::11::79:: Rama,the mighty elder brother of Lakshmana, having said so to Sugriva in a pleasing manner, lifted the dried body of Dundubhi easily with his toe, shook it and flung it with ease to a distance of ten yojanas.
4::11::80::Having seen Rama flinging the body, Sugriva said to him again in the presence of Lakshmanameaningfully:
4::11::81::'O friend, when Vali my brother flung the body, he was tired and intoxicated and the body was fresh with flesh (meaning heavy), but now, O Delight of the Raghu race, it is fleshless and light like a bunch of (dry) grass (for) which you could throw it playfully.
4::11::82::'I was unable to gauge whether your strength is more  than his (Vali's) since there is a great difference between a dry body and a wet one.
4::11::83::'O Dear, therefore, I have my doubt about your relative strength. If you can split a sala tree with a single arrow then can your strength or weakness be demonstrated.
4::11::84::'Now string your bow, draw it like the trunk of an elephant up to your ear and release the great arrow.
4::11::85::'It will be enough and my doubt will be cleared. If you can pierce the sala tree with your arrow it will be my pleasure and not a test of your strength.
4::11::86:: 'Just as the Sun is the best among the brilliant, the Himalayas among the great mountains, the lion among the quadrupeds, so also you are the best among men of valour.'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये किष्किन्धाकाण्डे एकादशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends  the eleventh sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.
