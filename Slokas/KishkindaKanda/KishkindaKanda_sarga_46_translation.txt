4::46::2::Then offering reverential salutation to Rama, Sugriva said, 'I shall narrate in detail. Listen, O bull among men 
4::46::3::Vali chased the demon Dundubhi in buffalo form into a cave of mount Malaya in order to kill him.
4::46::4:: 'Then I waited at the entrance of the cave with due loyalty. A year passed. Yet Vali did not return. 
4::46::5::'There seeing the cave overflowing with the gushing blood, I was bewildered, thinking that my brother might have been killed. I suffered intense agony.
4::46::6::'Thereafter, convinced that my brother was killed, I placed a mountainsize rock at the entrance of the cave so that Dundubhi will be destroyed, unable to come out of the cave.
4::46::7::'I lost hope of his life and came back to Kishkinda. Having got the kingdom, and also Ruma and Tara, I was anointed king and ruled it fearlessly with all friends.
4::46::8:: 
4::46::9::'The evilminded Vali, having lost his selfcontrol, ran after me in anger, to kill me and my ministers. I kept running.

4::46::20::'O prince Rama then I reached mount Rishyamuka which Vali did not enter out of fear of the curse of Matanga.
4::46::21::'O king that way I surveyed the entire earth directly and returned to this cave and lived here.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये किष्किन्धाकाण्डे षटचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortysixth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
