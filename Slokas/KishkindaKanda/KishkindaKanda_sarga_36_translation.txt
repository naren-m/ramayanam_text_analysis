4::36::1::Thus the gentlenatured Saumitri accepted Tara's courteous words sanctioned by dharma.
4::36::2::Sugriva, king of the vanara clan, cast aside his great fear when Lakshmana accepted the words of Tara just as one discards a wet garment from the body.
4::36::3::Thereupon Sugriva, relieved from his drunken state tore off the great, colourful valuable garland worn on his neck.
4::36::4::Sugriva, the noblest of all monkeys, spoke these polite words in a pleasing manner to Lakshmana of terrific strength:
4::36::5::'O Saumitri my prosperity, fame and the permanent sovereignty of vanaras had been lost. It was  regained by the grace of Rama. 
4::36::6::'O crusher of enemies  how is it possible to repay the famous lord Rama's valour (in killing Vali)?
4::36::7::'Righteous Rama can merely restore Sita with my assistance. By his own fiery energy he will kill Ravana.
4::36::8::'Rama shattered seven huge trees, a mountain and earth with a single arrow. What assistance does he need?
4::36::9::'O Lakshmana the twang of his bow shook even the mountains and the earth. What assistance does he need?
4::36::10::'O Lakshmana, bull among men I shall only join him along with others when he leads the army to kill Ravana.
4::36::11::'If I have committed even a little transgression in my faith in Rama or affection for him and exceeded the time limit, my mistakes are to be excused as one would pardons a servant. No one is flawless in the world.' 
4::36::12::Lakshmana who was happy to hear great Sugriva replied affectionately:
4::36::13::'O Sugriva, king of monkeys when you are extending due courtesy to my brother,he has a guardian in you by all means. 
4::36::14::'You are powerful and straightforward by nature.You are humble and noble. Therefore, you deserve the high prosperity of the kingdom of the monkeys.
4::36::15::'O Sugriva with you as associate, valiant hero Rama will kill his enemies in war very soon. There is no doubt about it.
4::36::16::'O Sugriva you know dharma.You are grateful and will not turn back from the battle. So your words are true and befitting.
4::36::17::'O best of monkeys barring you and my elder brother, who else would be capable of speaking this way about themselves even when you are aware of other's faults?
4::36::18::'You who are equal to Rama in valour and strength, will continue to be the gift of gods to us for long.
4::36::19:: 'Nevertheless I want you to proceed from here with me at once and reassure your friend who is agrieved due to the abduction of his wife.
4::36::20::इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामयणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये किष्किन्धाकाण्डे षट्त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtysix sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
