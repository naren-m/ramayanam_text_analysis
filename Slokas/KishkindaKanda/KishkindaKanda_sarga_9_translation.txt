4::9::1::'My elder brother called Vali, capable of exterminating enemies was always highly regarded by my father and me.
4::9::2::
4::9::3::'I served him obediently like a servant while he ruled over the great  ancestral kingdom inherited by him.
4::9::4::'Dundubhi's eldest son Mayabi was a mighty demon. He developed bitter enmity with Vali for the sake of a woman.
4::9::5::'One midnight when all were asleep, he (Mayabi) came to the entrance of Kishkinda screaming angrily and bellowing at Vali, challenging him to a duel. 
4::9::6::' My brother Vali, who was asleep could not tolerate the frightful sound and jumped out of bed hastily.
4::9::7::'Enraged, he came out to kill the powerful demon even though I with the womenfolk (of the harem) tried to prevent him.
4::9::8::'That mighty warrior(Vali) came out, pushing aside all the womenfolk. I too followed  him due to my affection towards him.
4::9::9::'On seeing my brother and me from a distance, the demon took to his heels scared.
4::9::10::'Frightened, he ran. We too chased him running faster. As the Moon was rising the path was welllit.
4::9::11:: 'The demon entered into a hole (cave) covered with a heap of grass, difficult, therefore, of access. Both of us reached there and took position.
4::9::12::'Seeing the enemy entering the cave, Vali became wrathful and his senses were terribly disturbed.He said to me:
4::9::13::'O Sugriva wait here at the entrance of the cave and be on your alert until I enter this hole and kill the enemy'.
4::9::14::'On hearing him, I begged the scorcher of enemies (Vali) that I would follow him, but he made me swear on his feet and entered the cave. 
4::9::15::
4::9::16::'Thinking him dead, I became agitated because of my love for him. My mind began to apprehend his death since I had not seen my brother for long.
4::9::17::
4::9::18::'I heard the roaring voices of the demons and not the yelling of my brother engaged in the duel.
4::9::19::'O friend by those signs I understood that my brother was killed and concluding that way I blocked the entrance of the cave with a rock of the size of a mountain and offered oblations to my brother and came to Kishkinda. I intended to hide the fact of Vali's death. But the ministers came to know the truth with their efforts.
4::9::20::'Then all the ministers assembled together and consecrated me. While I was ruling the kingdom lawfully, Vali, the monkey came back after killing the enemy demon.
4::9::21::'Seeing me on the throne, Vali became angry and his eyes turned red. He imprisoned my ministers and spoke to me harshly. 
4::9::22::'O Rama even though I was capable of restraining the sinner, my intellect did not let me do so out of respect for my brother. 
4::9::23::'When my brother came back to the town after killing the enemy, I offered as usual my salutations to him. But he did not bless me wholeheartedly.
4::9::24::'O lord I bowed at his feet with my crown in total submission. Even then Vali was not pleased a bit. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये किष्किन्धाकाण्डे नवमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the ninth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
